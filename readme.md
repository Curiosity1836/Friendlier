<p>This is just a small website that grabs steam friends from the steam api. Made mostly just to poke fun at Epic.</p>

<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
    <li>add online status indicators using Vue.js</li>
    <li>sort the list</li>
    <li>probably needs more commenting</li>
    <li>re add input sanitizing</li>
</ul>
