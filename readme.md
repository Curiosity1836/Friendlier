<p>This is just a small website that grabs steam friends from the steam api. Made mostly just to poke fun at Epic Games.</p>
<p>My actual changes are in views, sass inside /resources also in app/http/controllers/steamcontroller.php.</p>

<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
    <li>add online status indicators using Vue.js</li>
    <li>sort the list</li>
    <li>probably needs more commenting</li>
    <li>re add input sanitizing</li>
</ul>
